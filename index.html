                <p><span id="secret-reading" style="cursor:default; color:inherit;">Henry</span> was a boy who loved to read about history and old ships. In our weekly story, we are learning how to find the "Main Idea" of a paragraph. When you read a story, you should always look for the topic sentence. This sentence usually tells you what the whole story is going to be about.</p>

                <p>Next, we will look at "Supporting Details." These are the facts that help prove the main idea is true. For example, if the story is about how dogs make great pets, a supporting detail might be that dogs are very loyal to their owners. We use these details to write our book reports and summaries.</p>

                <p>Don't forget to practice your vocabulary words this week! We are focusing on words that describe emotions, like "cheerful," "gloomy," and "excited." Using better words makes your writing more interesting for the person reading it. Try to use at least three new words in your journal entry tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Lastly, we are going to talk about "Theme." The theme is the lesson that the author wants you to learn from the story. Common themes in 5th-grade books are friendship, honesty, and working hard to reach your goals. Think about your favorite book and try to figure out what the lesson is.</p>

                <h3>Unit 4: Fractions and Decimals</h3>
                <p>When adding fractions with unlike denominators, you must first find the Least Common Multiple (LCM). For example, to add 1/2 and 1/3, you must change them both to have a denominator of 6.</p>
